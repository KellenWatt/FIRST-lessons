# FRC Programming Lessons
Simplified programming lessons for FIRST Robotics.

First, I need to make a few things perfectly clear. First, these lessons do not 
teach everything in the language(s) they cover. They're not supposed to. They 
are inteneded to teach everything necessary to understand the languages supported 
by the FIRST Robotic Competition (FRC). Second, these lessons are not comprehensive 
on the topics they cover. They're not supposed to be. These lessons are intended 
to be used as teaching tools for FRC teams, not as a college textbook.
