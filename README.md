# FRC Programming Lessons
Simplified programming lessons for FIRST Robotics.

First things first, I need to make a few things perfectly clear. 
1. These lessons do not teach everything in the language(s) they cover. They're 
not supposed to. They are inteneded to teach everything necessary to understand 
the languages supported by the FIRST Robotic Competition (FRC). 
2. These lessons are not comprehensive on the topics they cover. They're not 
supposed to be. These lessons are intended to be used as teaching tools for FRC 
teams, not as a college textbook. As such, they only provide practical information, 
relevant to using the language to program a robot using the official libraries 
for the language. By all means, this can be supplemented by other lessons or the 
instructor's own knowledge, but completeness is not a goal here. Refer to the 
specification of the language in question for such information.
