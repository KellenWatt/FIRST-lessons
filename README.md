# FRC Programming Lessons
Simplified programming lessons for FIRST Robotics.

First things first, I need to make a few things perfectly clear. 
1. These lessons do not teach everything about the language(s) they cover. They're 
not supposed to. They are inteneded to teach everything necessary to understand 
and work with the languages supported by the FIRST Robotic Competition (FRC). 
2. These lessons are not comprehensive on the topics they cover. They're not 
supposed to be. These lessons are intended to be used a a teaching tool for FRC 
teams, not as a college textbook. As such, they only provide practical information, 
relevant to using the language to program a robot using the official libraries 
for the language. 

Now, by all means, these points can be supplemented by other sources or the 
instructor's own knowledge. In fact, I heartily encourage this. However, 
completeness is not a goal here. These lessons are designed to be taught to 
high school students at an accelerated pace compared to a full college-level 
course on the subject(s), with the students in question possibly having never 
even seen a terminal before outside of a movie. As such, a signficant amount of 
information has been left out for simplicity and brevity.

Please note that none of the code written or instructions given are designed to
teach good or idiomatic code. If they happen to do so, that's fantastic, but
the foremost goal is teaching concepts, and giving them a concrete, understandable 
form. Everything else is fluff that doesn't help the student get started programming.
The exception to this is naming conventions in a given language, which will be 
specifically covered in the lesson on variables, and more, as appropriate. 
Idiomatic code isn't a goal, but readable code is still important.

The target time for instruction is around 20 hours of teaching (pending testing). This doesn't 
include exercises or remedial lessons, which could easily double that time, 
though that can be partially amortized by using time outside of instruction periods.

## Should I use this?
Excellent question! Let me be the first to say that this format won't work 
for everybody, and you should only teach/learn using a resource you're comfortable 
with. If this isn't one of those things, I wish you godspeed in your learning 
and have some resources listed in each language's README. Use them as you see fit.

There are two main points to consider before using these lessons: your proficiency 
and your students' proficiencies. To evaluate that, read the following sentence:

> FRC's WPIlib is based on a mixture of imperative and declarative programming with strong object-oriented influences.

First, your proficiency. If you understand what this means or you have a solid 
grasp on your language of choice, then you can absolutely use this. If not, I 
encourage you to find a programming book or other tutorial that familiarizes 
you with these concepts and your language. After that, feel free to come back.

Second, your students' proficiencies. If they understand what that sentence 
means and have a solid grasp of your language of choice, then you don't need 
these lessons, and you should get them working on actual robot code ASAP. If not,
these lessons are designed for them.

The idea behind these lessons is to have a mentor with moderate to strong experience
programming teaching inexperienced students how to write robot code. These lessons
will hopefully benefit other students and mentors, but this is the core idea.

## Getting Started
These lessons are not intended to be used as-is.

Using these lessons are fairly simple. The basic format of these are intended to 
be slightly fleshed-out teaching notes. That is, there's an order, and some 
explanations, but it isn't necessarily complete; just enough to act as guidelines 
for what is being covered. As such, it behooves the instructor to look at them 
beforehand and have a plan for what to teach. This can even include switching 
lessons around or scrapping them entirely (though if you do the latter, please create an issue on the 
Github repository, and tell me what you did and why you did it.)

Code provided in this repository is solely for the purposes of demonstration, and 
should not be used for exercises. See the [exercises](#) repository for appropriate 
exercises for a lesson. The code itself is guaranteed to compile and run (or 
interpret, as appropriate), and most examples have comments describing the purpose 
of the code and notes detailing the syntacic or semantic elements being introduced.
